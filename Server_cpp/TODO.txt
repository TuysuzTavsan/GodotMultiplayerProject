How will server work?

Host is the master class that will poll every client event.
There are 4 types of events in ENetLibrary.
ENET_EVENT_TYPE_NONE
ENET_EVENT_TYPE_CONNECT
ENET_EVENT_TYPE_RECEIVE
ENET_EVENT_TYPE_DISCONNECT

Connect and Disconnect will be handled by the clientDistributor.
It will hold every valid client connection in its private containers.

On the event receive messageDistributor will distribute messages based on MessageProtocol.
Example: Physics related messages will be parsed out from the message and directed to the desired handler. Same will be applied to lobby messages... etc.


TODO: MessageParser.

LobbyHandler
GameSessionHandler
